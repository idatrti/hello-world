# hello-world
This is my first (and so far best) repository

I am currently working as a Simulation Engineer at Volvo in Malmö, Sweden. I live in Lund, but we're soon moving to our house in Eslöv.

This project comes from my new(re!)found interest in programming, which I somehow lost after my high school studies (even though I kind of work with coding a bit).
